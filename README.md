- 👋 Hi, I’m @shayshunk
- 👀 I’m interested in particle (mainly optical) simulations using GEANT4, as well as data analysis in neutrino physics. I also have side interests in game development and AI. 
- 🌱 I’m currently working on adding Machine Learning to my repertoire. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on particle physics in general. 
- 📫 How to reach me: sj622@drexel.edu
